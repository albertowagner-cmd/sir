# Stock Info Reader & Strategy Backtesting

The project aims to develop a strategy for stocks trading, it uses python to retrieve all the data from Yahoo Finance, and also for plot visualization ( this code can be found in the script folder).
We then implement all the strategies and backtesting of them in C++. The stocks are retrieved and saved in CSV files, then we read them inside the C++ program.
